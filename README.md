## Write-up

My research for this project started a few months ago when i started a web development course with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I only made it about halfway through the course but i learned alot about basic HTML and CSS. I began by making a static website that could be used as a fake login form, where the login is set by the user then the program could attempt to login. However I wanted to go a step further and learn basic back end development, so I took the challenge and remade the website using NodeJS and MySql to create a dynamic login form, with the ability to register accounts as well. I think the best way to learn something new is to follow a tutorial first, and do your best to understand what they do, then go a step further and add something on your own (in my case the register function / basic home page). I am not a backend developer at all yet, but this project was a good learning expeirence that taught me alot about how the backend of websites and servers are handled. The actual LoginBot was a quick add, and only took a short while after I learned how to make POST Requests with the [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) library. While its not amazing that I made a loginBot that breaks into my own website comapred to a real bot capable of stealing logins from something such as RuneScape or Minecraft, I'm still proud I was able to make a non-static working login page with a language I'm not familiar with.
